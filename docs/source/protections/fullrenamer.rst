FullRenamer
===========

How it works?
-------------

Protection renames types/methods/fields, however, ignores things such as reflection, Unity Methods (Update/FixedUpdate/LateUpdate, i.e all of them), overrides from Thanking (OV_methodName), and the most popular frameworks for plugin development in Unturned and Rust on GitHub - RocketMod, OpenMod, and rust-oxide-umod, you even could specify your methods/types to ignore.

If you want you can easily configure `criticals.json` to ignore strings and lot of stuff. 

Be careful, because renamer is tricky protection, not always useful, and does not always work properly. But, if you configure BitMono correctly Renamer can be a great protection (I'm about big projects, not crackmes).

Protection Type
---------------

The protection type is `Protection`.
