When and why use BitMono?
=========================

You know the answer, but let me open your eyes.

There are a lot of obfuscators/protectors, paid and free but most of them are out of support, more and more often I see new issues/pull-request, but it's just being ignored by the open-source maintainers, this is sad. I have no doubt that BitMono could have such a future too, but, at any moment BitMono can be easily forked and supported by anyone, because of its clean code, architecture, and AsmResolver as an assembly manipulator.

- Write your own protection, but you don't want to use ConfuserEx engine or writing your own.
- Protect your intelictual property against reversers, at least, let them spend more time on it.
- Protect yourself against skids.
- Protect game cheat against anti-cheats.
- Contribute to the BitMono.
