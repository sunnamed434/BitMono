BitMono is a free open-source C# obfuscator that in most cases works **only** with Mono - well known as a fork of .NET framework (which runs popular platforms such as Unity, etc), you can still use this for a whole .NET, but be careful that something working not as intentional, because the main target of the this project is Mono (actually some protections don't work with Mono but work with .NET Core). Which uses **[AsmResolver][asmresolver]** for assembly manipulation (not a dnlib as you might already think). If you have any questions/issues please let me know **[there][bitmono_issues]**. You can install the latest version of BitMono **[here][bitmono_releases]**.

## Usability
BitMono breaks the most popular tools using just one packer, such as:
- dnSpy;
- dnlib;
- AsmResolver;
- MonoCecil;
- ILSpy;
- PEBear;
- DetectItEasy;
- CFF Explorer
- Perhaps, some dumpers?
- and many, many more...

So, if you will add more protection to the file, I think it would seem like total magic. :D

## Documentation
Read the **[docs][bitmono_docs]** to read protection, functionality, and more.

## How your app will look since BitMono obfuscation - just in a few words
* Looks like C++ application but is an actual C# application;
* Crash of decompilers when analyzing types;
* Broken decompilers;
* Broken IL Code;
* Invisible types;
* No code

## Features
* StringsEncryption
* **[UnmanagedString][unmanagedstring_source]** (based on existing protection)
* **[BitDotNet][bitdotnet_source]** (based and improved on existing protection)
* **[BitMethodDotnet][bitmethoddotnet_source]** (based and improved on existing protection)
* **[DotNetHook][dotnethook_source]** (based on existing protection)
* CallToCalli
* ObjectReturnType
* NoNamespaces
* FullRenamer
* AntiDebugBreakpoints
* AntiDecompiler
* BitDateTimeStamp
* BitMono
* BillionNops

## Usage

### Using CLI
`BitMono.CLI <path to file>/drag-and-drop`

Always drop dependencies in `libs` directory in the same path where `file` for obfuscation is located

Your obfuscation directory structure will look something like this:
```
specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/
├─ your_app.exe
└─ libs/
  ├─ ImportantLibrary.dll
  ├─ SuperImportantLibrary.dll
  └─ ...
```

Copy all libraries (.dll) from the building application folder and paste them into the `libs` directory (if it doesn't exist yet create it), or even create the libs directory yourself with a custom name for example - `myLibs`, and then specify it in BitMono, however, if you will use `libs` then by default BitMono looking for a `libs` directory, so it will save your time.

### Using CLI Commands
```console
  -f, --file         Required. Set file path.

  -l, --libraries    Set libraries path.

  -o, --output       Set output path.

  --help             Display this help screen.

  --version          Display version information.
```

Basic example
```console
$ BitMono.CLI -f C:\specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/your_app.exe -l specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/libs
```

In case when you already have a directory with the name `libs` (specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation\libs) BitMono will catch it automatically, so, you don't need to specify it anymore, but you can in case if you made another directory with `libs` somewhere on the disk or even just for "visibility".
```console
$ BitMono.CLI -f C:\specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/your_app.exe
```

Specify custom `libs` directory
```console
$ BitMono.CLI -f C:\specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/your_app.exe -l C:\mythings\obfuscation\superLibsDirectory
```

Specify file, libs and output. If output directory doesn't exist BitMono will create it automatically and even open it on the top of the screen, if you want you can disable opening of the directory on the of top of the screen in `obfuscation.json` - and set `OpenFileDestinationInFileExplorer` to false.
```console
$ BitMono.CLI -f C:\specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/your_app.exe -l C:\mythings\obfuscation\superLibsDirectory -o C:\specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/output
```

Want more? Simply read the **[docs][bitmono_docs]**.

### Troubleshooting
Access Denied
Try to set `OpenFileDestinationInFileExplorer` to `false` in `obfuscation.json`

### Detailed build status
If you want to build the BitMono by your own - [click here for detailed info][build_info]

| Branch | AppVeyor                                                    |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| main   | [![Build status][image_appveyor_main]][appveyor_main_build] |
| dev    | [![Build status][image_appveyor_dev]][appveyor_dev_build]   |

### Supported Frameworks
Mono is supported obviously (some protections don't support Mono), however if you use BitMono for .NET (Core) or higher versions be careful because some protections won't work - you will be notified about that by BitMono when using not supported protections for yours running target framework.

| Framework      | Version |
|----------------|---------|
| .NET (Core)    | 6.0     |
| .NET Framework | 462     |
| netstandard    | 2.0     |
| netstandard    | 2.1     |
